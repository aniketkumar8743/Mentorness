# Internship at Mentorness - 1-Month Project-Based Internship

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed during my one-month project-based internship at Mentorness, a company focused on data analysis and visualization. During this internship, I worked on three key projects: a Video Project, NREGA Power BI Dashboard, and a COVID-19 Data Analysis Project using SQL. Each of these projects allowed me to enhance my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and SQL, as well as improve my proficiency with tools such as Power BI and Python.

## Projects
1. Video Project:
This project focused on creating a video presentation to explain and showcase the methodology and findings from my data analysis and visualization work during the internship. It helped in summarizing the objectives, techniques, and outcomes of each project.
Key Features:

Detailed walkthrough of data analysis techniques used.
Insights derived from the analysis presented in a concise video format.
Designed for easy understanding by both technical and non-technical audiences.

2. NREGA Data Visualization using Power BI:
In this project, I created a Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics related to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). The goal was to analyze and present NREGA data in an insightful manner, which could be used for tracking the performance and implementation of the scheme.

Key Features:

Visualized key indicators such as employment rates, fund allocation, and regional performance.
Designed interactive filters and graphs for easy data exploration.
Provided a comprehensive overview of the NREGA schemeâ€™s impact on rural employment.
Focused on delivering insights for better decision-making in policy planning and implementation.

3. COVID-19 Data Analysis Project using SQL:
For this project, I worked with COVID-19 data to analyze trends and patterns, providing valuable insights for public health strategies. The analysis was carried out using SQL to extract and manipulate data from large datasets, followed by the creation of detailed reports.

Key Features:

Analyzed COVID-19 case data across different regions, focusing on trends over time.
Conducted data aggregation and filtering to identify the most affected areas.
Generated key insights into the impact of the pandemic based on demographics, region, and timing.
Used SQL queries to perform complex calculations and generate meaningful reports.

## Technologies & Tools Used

Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation in the NREGA project.
SQL: For querying and analyzing COVID-19 data.
Python: Used for scripting and automating data processing tasks.
Excel: Used for preliminary data exploration and manipulation.

## Learning Outcomes

Enhanced proficiency in Power BI and SQL through hands-on projects.
Improved skills in data visualization, making complex data accessible and understandable to stakeholders.
Gained valuable experience in conducting data analysis, drawing actionable insights from large datasets.
Learned how to present data-driven insights in a clear and professional manner for decision-making.

## Conclusion

This internship at Mentorness provided me with practical experience in data analysis and visualization, which has strengthened my skills in tools like SQL, Power BI, and Python. The projects I completed were instrumental in developing my ability to handle real-world datasets and deliver insights in a clear, actionable format.
